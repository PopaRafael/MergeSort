# MergeSort
Merge Sort is inherently recursive. It recursively divides the array into smaller subarrays and then combines them in a sorted manner.
* Merge Sort is also efficient with a stable time complexity of O(n log n) for all cases.
* It is stable and works well for linked lists.
* Merge Sort is not an in-place sorting algorithm and requires additional memory.
